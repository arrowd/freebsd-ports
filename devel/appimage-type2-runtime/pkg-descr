AppImage is an application package format that provides a way for upstream
developers to provide all the dependencies that cannot be assumed to be part of
each target system in a recent enough version.

This package provdes the AppImage runtime, which is a statically-linked
executable part of every AppImage. It mounts the payload via FUSE and executes
the entrypoint.
